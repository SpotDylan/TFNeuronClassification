# Use of Tensorflow in the Classification Of Neurons
This project uses TensorFlow to build ANN models that attempt to classify large sets of neurons based on morphological characteristics

Project Title: The Exploration of Machine Learning for Morphological Neuron Classification in the Neocortex 

Abstract:This study discusses the applications of machine learning techniques to classify neurons based on their morphological features. By utilizing these models, neurons can be accurately identified and 
categorized based on their shape and structure. The study outlines the various deep-learning models used in this classification process, including artificial neural networks, convoluted neural networks, 
and feed-forward neural networks. The use of deep learning models allows for more efficient and effective research, as they can analyze large amounts of data faster and more accurately than traditional methods. 
This improved methodology has the potential to accelerate the development of targeted therapies for a variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Huntingtonâ€™s. 
The algorithm can effectively target these two diseases by exploring the neural functions with the Cerebral Cortex specifically. Overall, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of using deep learning models 
in the classification of neurons and highlights the potential for further exploration in this area.

Installation
The project simply requires you run the .py files within the folder. Using an IDE or Notebook environment is recommended, but it is possible to simply install Python and run the project

Dependencies
It will be necessary to install certain packages in order for our program to function properly. These include:
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install selenium

Usage
The 'scraper' modules should be run first in order to gather sufficient data, but much data cleaning is needed manually or by program.
In this project, data cleaning was done manually with scraping being automated. Model.py is the main module that will build and test our Artificial Neural Network.
